        subtitle: 'Previously A1 Code Academy,'
        content: >
          our beginnings were humble.


          Our first class began in 2019, branded under the academy name "A1 Code
          Academy". Our classes focused purely around coding, which today has
          evolved into a more holistic curriculum, introducing topics such as
          entrepreneurship, personal finance, and data analytics. Since the
          Covid-19 Crisis of 2020, Pluto Academy (then A1 Code Academy) moved
          all its classes online.

          From finding the right video platform to engage our students, to
          guiding our parents through this transition to online-based learning,
          things were not easy for anyone. Our team spent an entire week,
          burning through our curriculum materials to optimize them for the
          online-learning experience.

          Realizing the changing economy and needs of future leaders in
          Singapore, our courses and curriculum standards evolved.

          Education Certified, to ensuring a smooth classroom experience and
          learning experience for both our parents and children, Pluto Academy
          today prides itself with delivering quality, holistic education to
          support each and every child in her/his education journey.
