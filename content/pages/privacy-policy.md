Our Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information about you or associated with you (“personal information”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. This Privacy Policy applies to the online services offered by Pluto Academy such as our website at [www.plutoacademy.co](http://www.plutoacademy.co), our mobile app Pluto Academy Go, and any other online service location (collectively the “Service”) that makes this Privacy Policy available to you.

By using the Service, you agree to our Terms of Use and consent to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Service.

If you have any questions or wish to exercise your rights and choices, please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section.

## **Information Collection**

This section will discuss what type of information is collected. This includes categories of information that (1) you provide to us directly, (2) is collected by us automatically, and (3) we receive from third-party sources.

### **1. Information You Provide Directly to Us**

You can browse our site without providing personal information, but you must register in order to access most of the features of Service. Certain personal information—such as a user name, email address—are required to create an account. However, after you set up an account, you may choose what additional information may be shared through public profiles, including your name, location, website, links to your social media profiles, and other information that may be considered personal information. Similarly, should you choose to engage in messaging through the Service, the contents of such messages may be processed and saved by us. You may choose to voluntarily provide other information to us that we do not request, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.

The following are categories of information we collect and have collected directly from you in the last 12 months:

*   **Contact Data**, including your first and last name, email address, postal address, and phone number.

*   **Account Credentials**, including your username, password, password hints, and information for authentication and account access.

*   **Demographic Data**, including your age, gender, and country.

*   **Billing Data**, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit or debit card number), expiration date, and security code as necessary to process your payments.

*   **Profile Data**, including your interests, inferences, preferences and favorites.

*   **Content**, including content within any messages you send to us (such as feedback and questions to customer support) or publicly post on the Service (such as in your public profile, in reviews, and comments) as well as any academic content that you generate and submit for grading. We also collect content within any messages you exchange with other users through the Service (such as if you use our chat functionalities).

*   **Personal Contacts Data**, including the first and last name, email address, and phone number of your personal contacts. We collect data about your contacts with your consent and in order to fulfill a request by you, such as finding your contacts on the Service or inviting your contacts to join the Service. Such functionality is only intended for U.S. residents. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the U.S. and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to use their contact information to fulfill your request.

*   **Job Applicant Data**, including your employment and education history, transcript, writing samples, and references as necessary to consider your job application for open positions.

You may choose to voluntarily provide other information to us, and, in such instances, you are solely responsible for such information.

### **2. Information Collected Automatically**

In addition, we automatically collect information when you use the Service. The categories of information we automatically collect and have collected in the last 12 months includes:

*   **Service Use Data**, including data about features you use, pages you visit, emails and advertisements you view, products and services you view and purchase, the time of day you browse, and your referring and exiting pages.

*   **Device Data**, including data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating software, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and device identifiers such as IP address and Ad Id.

*   **Location Data**, including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level) and, with your consent, precise location data (such as latitude/longitude data).

We use various current – and later – developed tracking technologies to automatically collect information when you use the Service, including the following:

*   **Log Files**, which are files that record events that occur in connection with your use of the Service.

*   **Cookies**, which are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.

*   **Pixels** (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels from separate entities that allow us to track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.

*   **Device Fingerprinting**, which is the process of analyzing and combining sets of data elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your browser and device.

*   **App Technologies**, which are technologies included in our apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.

*   **Location-Identifying Technologies**, which are technologies used to collect your location. For example, GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth may be used to collect precise location data when you consent to precise location tracking through our apps. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device’s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.

For further information on how we use tracking technologies for analytics and advertising, and your rights and choices regarding them, see the “Analytics and Advertising” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections below.

### **3. Information From Other Sources**

We offer parts of our Service through websites, platforms, and services operated or controlled by separate entities. In addition, we integrate technologies operated or controlled by separate entities into parts of our Service. Some examples include:

*   **Links**. Our Service includes links that hyperlink to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us. We may get a commission if you purchase a product after clicking on a link to an affiliate’s website.

*   **Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In**. We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to “like” or “share” content on, or log-in to your account through social media.

Please note that the social network may independently collect information about you through the integration.

Please note that when you interact with other entities, including when you leave our Service, those entities may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by those entities remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

## **Analytics and Advertising**

We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Service. In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other technology services to place ads about our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.

As part of this process, we may incorporate tracking technologies into our own Service (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“Interest-based Advertising”).

We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Service or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to a technology service or incorporating a pixel from a technology service into our own Service, and the technology service matching common factors between our data and their data. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Service and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences. Some technology services may provide us with their own data, which is then uploaded into another technology service for matching common factors between those datasets.

As indicated above, vendors may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.

For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use on the Service and your rights and choices regarding analytics, Interest-based Advertising, and Matched Ads, please see the “Information Collected Automatically” and “Your Rights and Choices” sections.

Please note that we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. European data subjects and California residents have additional rights as set forth in the sections entitled “Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in Europe” and “Additional Disclosures for California Residents” below.

### **2. Tracking Technology Choices.**

If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

*   **Do Not Track.** Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

*   **App and Location Technologies.** You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your device Ad ID at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you. You can stop all collection of precise location data through an app by uninstalling the app or withdrawing your consent through your device settings.

Please be aware that if you disable or remove tracking technologies some parts of the Service may not function correctly.

### **3. Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising.**

Google provides tools to allow you to opt out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> and by Google Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at <https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/> .

The companies we work with to provide you with targeted ads are required by us to give you the choice to opt out of receiving targeted ads. Most of these companies are participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the targeted ads provided by these companies, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them, please visit: (i) for website targeted ads from DAA participants, <https://www.aboutads.info/choices>; (ii) for app targeted ads from DAA participants, <https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices>; and (iii) for targeted ads from NAI participants, <https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services).

To opt out of us using your data for Matched Ads, please contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify that you wish to opt out of matched ads. We will request that the applicable technology service not serve you matched ads based on information we provide to it. Alternatively, you may directly contact the applicable technology service to opt out.

You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices) or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices).

Please note that if you opt out using any of these methods, the opt out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any opt out options or programs, or the accuracy of any other entities’ statements regarding their opt out options or programs.

### **4. Communications.**
