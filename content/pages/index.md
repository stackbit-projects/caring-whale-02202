        subtitle: '$35 Per Student, 1.5 hours Per Class'
        content: >
          If you’re an adult data enthusiast, then you know what it feels like
          to uncover a powerful insight within your data. But this aha moment
          doesn’t have to be restricted to grownups.


          So how do you introduce kids with no data background into the data
          world? **Give them that same aha experience, of course!**


          Kid or grownup, it takes the same two ingredients to get someone
          started on their data journey: **a data set that appeals to the
          person’s interests, and questions that the data can help answer.**
          When you have these two things, you can’t help but be intrigued! And
          kids are no exception. Join us for this interactive and fun 1.5 hour
          session where you and your child will be using Tableau  to experience
          an introduction to Data Analysis!

          “My girls, ages 7 and 9, really enjoyed their first class with their
          teacher at Pluto Academy. They liked her very much and told me they
          enjoyed the class. They get so excited to make programs that they have
          the ability to control! Highly recommended!”

          "I found the Data Analysis course was very well structured and
          engaging. As a data science person myself, I find it hard to explain
          what I do to my son. I'm glad he got the chance to participate in this
          course, the teacher managed to decipher what I do into very
          easy-to-understand pieces of learning content."
